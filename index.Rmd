## Motivation

It is hard for anyone to find a good restaurant, no matter if they stay in the same place for a long time or just move in like us. When people do not know where to eat, rating apps such as yelp would be a key resource for people to use. However, it led to an interesting question to us: what factors could correlate with rates or stars.
